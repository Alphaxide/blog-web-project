                    <P class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-9"> At the age of 16 he met Patrick Sang, a Kenyan runner who became his longtime coach. In 2003 Kipchoge recorded his first major win, narrowly defeating Morocco’s Hicham El Guerrouj in the 5,000 metres at that year’s world championship. Specializing in that distance, Kipchoge later won a bronze medal at the 2004 Olympics in Athens and a silver at the 2008 Games in Beijing. He also captured a silver medal at the 2007 world championships. </P>

                <div class="bg-slate-900 text-white pt-8 pl-3 pb-8">
                    <h1 class="font-bold text-4xl ml-9 mb-8 mt-8 ">THE JOURNEY</h1>
                    <P class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">Kipchoge claimed his first individual world championship title in 2003 by winning the junior race at the World Cross Country Championships, and setting a world junior record over 5000 m on the track. At the age of eighteen, he became the senior 5000 m world champion at the 2003 World Championships with a championships record, then followed with an Olympic bronze for Kenya in 2004 and a bronze at the 2006 World Indoor Championships. A five-time World Championship 5000 m finalist, Kipchoge took silver medals at the 2007 World Championships, 2008 Beijing Olympics and 2010 Commonwealth Games.</P>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">He switched to road running in 2012 and made the second-fastest half marathon debut ever, at 59:25. In his marathon debut, he won the 2013 Hamburg Marathon in a course record time. His first victory at a World Marathon Major came at the Chicago Marathon in 2014, and he went on to become series champion for 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2022. He has won the London Marathon a record four times, and also shares the record for most Berlin Marathon wins with four, tied with Haile Gebrselassie. With 15 victories out of his 17 marathons, Kipchoge's only losses have been a second-place finish behind Wilson Kipsang Kiprotich at the 2013 Berlin Marathon, where Kipsang broke the world record, and an eighth-place finish at the 2020 London Marathon. Kipchoge's current world record run broke by 30 seconds his own 2018 world record, which was in turn a 78-second improvement over the existing best, the greatest improvement in a marathon world record time since 1967.</p>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">On 12 October 2019, Kipchoge ran the marathon distance for the Ineos 1:59 Challenge in Vienna, achieving a time of 1:59:40.2. The run did not count as a new marathon record, as standard competition rules for pacing and fluids were not followed and it was not an open event</p>

                    <h1 class="font-bold text-4xl ml-9 mb-8 mt-8 ">ELIUD KIPCHOGE YEAR SERIES</h1>

                    <h2 class="font-bold text-4xl ml-9 mb-8 mt-8 ">2002-2004</h2>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">In 2002, he won at the Kenyan trials for the 2002 IAAF World Cross Country Championships junior race. At the World Cross Country Championships, held in Dublin, Kipchoge finished fifth in the individual race and was part of the Kenyan junior team that won gold. Kipchoge also won the 5000 metres race at the Kenyan trial for the 2002 World Junior Championships in Athletics, but fell ill and missed the championships. At the 2003 IAAF World Cross Country Championships he won the junior race.</p>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">He set a world junior record in the 5000 m at the 2003 Bislett Games, running a time of 12:52.61 minutes. This stood as the world and African junior record until 2012, when it was improved to 12:47.53 minutes by Hagos Gebrhiwet of Ethiopia.</p>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">Kipchoge won a gold medal at the 5000 m final at the 2003 World Championships in Paris, outsprinting runner-up Hicham El Guerrouj, the world record holder in the 1500 metres and mile, by four hundredths of a second in 12:52.79. </p>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">In July, he participated in the Golden League 2004 Roma Meeting. In the 5000 m event, he dipped first among the starters with 12:46.53, which made him the sixth-fastest ever in the event</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="font-bold text-4xl ml-9 mb-8 mt-8 ">2006</h2>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">Kipchoge won the bronze in the 3000 metres indoor at the 2006 World Championships in Moscow.At the end of the year, Kipchoge won the San Silvestre Vallecana New Year's Eve 10 km road race in a time of 26:54 minutes, which beat his own course record by 40 seconds. This time was also better than the 10K road world record at the time, but was run on a downhill course.  </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="font-bold text-4xl ml-9 mb-8 mt-8 ">2007</h2>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">Kipchoge won a silver medal at the 5000 m final of the 2007 World Championships at Osaka in 13:46.00, behind Bernard Lagat (13:45.87). </p>

                    <h2 class="font-bold text-4xl ml-9 mb-8 mt-8 ">2008</h2>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">During the 2008 Olympics held in Beijing, China, Kipchoge won a silver medal in the 5000 m event with a time of 13:02.80; although better than the previous Olympic record of 13:05.59, it was not enough to match Kenenisa Bekele's pace, who won the gold medal for this race. On the circuit, he won the Great Yorkshire Run 10K and Campaccio Cross Country that year.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="font-bold text-4xl ml-9 mb-8 mt-8 ">2009</h2>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">He failed to reach the podium at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, finishing in fifth place. He also finished ninth in the 3000 m at the 2009 IAAF World Athletics Final.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-bold text-4xl ml-9 mb-8 mt-8 ">2010-2011</h2>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">He made his debut on the 2010 IAAF Diamond League by winning the 5000 m Qatar Athletic Super Grand Prix in a meet record time. </p>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">Kipchoge then went on to enter the Carlsbad 5000 in California, United States. The Carlsbad 5 km road race is the venue for the world best times for a 5k road race for men and women respectively. The fastest to cover the track was Sammy Kipketer in 2000, with 12:59.52 min. Kipchoge made a world best attempt and although he won the race, weather affected his chances and he finished in 13:11, the fourth-fastest ever for the course up to that point in time. </p>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">In the first athletics final of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, he attempted to win the 5000 m Commonwealth title. Ugandan runner Moses Kipsiro held a slender lead over him in the final stages of the race and Kipchoge ended up in second place, taking the silver medal some seven-hundredths of a second behind. He flew back to Europe immediately after to take part in the Belgrade Race through History the following day. His shoe fell off in the first kilometre and, after putting it back on, he made up much ground on the field to eventually take second place two seconds behind Josphat Menjo. </p>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">At the start of 2011, he won the short race at the Great Edinburgh Cross Country, ahead of Asbel Kiprop.  He attempted to retain his title at the Carlsbad 5000 in April but came a close second behind Dejen Gebremeskel. In May he raced the 3000 metres (finished third) in Doha, with a time of 7:27.66 and ranked him as the 12th-fastest at the distance up to this point. Kipchoge was chosen to represent Kenya at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics and reached the 5000 m final for the fifth consecutive time, although he only managed seventh place on this occasion.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="font-bold text-4xl ml-9 mb-8 mt-8 ">2012</h2>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">Kipchoge returned to the Edinburgh Cross Country in 2012, but this time he finished third behind Asbel Kiprop and Britain's Jonathan Hay. He was also third at the Carlsbad 5000 in March. He attempted to gain a place on the 10,000 m Olympic team at the Prefontaine Classic, but fell back in the late stages of the Kenyan trial race, finishing seventh. A seventh-place finish in the Kenyan 5000 m trial race meant he would not make a third consecutive Olympic team. </p>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">He made his half marathon debut in the Lille Half Marathon. The run was won by a new course record time of 59:05 (previously 59:36 by ilahun Regassa set in 2008) by Ezekiel Chebii (former pb 59:22), trailed by Bernard Koech 59:10, and Kipchoge earned a third place with 59:25. His time of 59:25 became the second fastest Half Marathon debut, only second to Moses Mosop's 59:20 in Milan in 2010. </p>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">On 6 October 2012, Kipchoge ran at the 2012 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in Kavarna, Bulgaria. Zsersenay Tadese of Eritrea won in 1:00:19 and Kipchoge placed sixth in 1:01:52. </p>

                    <h2 class="font-bold text-4xl ml-9 mb-8 mt-8 ">2013</h2>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">Kipchoge opened his 2013 season with a win at the Barcelona Half Marathon in a time of one hour and four seconds. Making his marathon debut in April, he demonstrated a smooth transition to the longer distance by taking the Hamburg Marathon title with a run of 2:05:30 hours, beating the field by over two minutes and setting a new course record. In August 2013, he won the Half Marathon of Klagenfurt in 1:01:02 minutes. </p>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">Then, he raced in the 2013 Berlin Marathon and finished second in 2:04:05, the fifth-fastest time in history, in his second-ever marathon, behind Wilson Kipsang, who set a new marathon world record with 2:03:23. Third place went to Geoffrey Kamworor of Kenya with 2:06:26. This was one of 11 world records since 1977 set at the Berlin Marathon (as of 2019). </p>

                    <h2 class="font-bold text-4xl ml-9 mb-8 mt-8 ">2015</h2>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">On 2 February, Kipchoge participated in the Ras al-Khaimah Half Marathon. He placed sixth with a time of 1:00:50. The run was won by Mosinet Geremew (Ethiopia) in 1:00:05. Kipchoge ran 2:04:42 to win the 2015 London Marathon in April. He also won the 2015 Berlin Marathon later in the year. His win and then-personal best time (2:04:00) occurred even though his shoes malfunctioned, causing his insoles to flap out of both shoes from 10 km onward; rather than risk time lost from an adjustment, he finished the race with bloodied, blistered feet.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="font-bold text-4xl ml-9 mb-8 mt-8 ">2016</h2>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">In April, Kipchoge won the 2016 London Marathon for the second consecutive year in a time of 2:03:05. His performance broke the course record in London, and became the second-fastest marathon time in history, missing Dennis Kimetto's world record by 8 seconds. </p>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">On 20 November 2016, Kipchoge ran in the Airtel Delhi Half Marathon, winning the race clocking a time of 59:44</p>

                    <h2 class="font-bold text-4xl ml-9 mb-8 mt-8 ">2017</h2>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">Eliud Kipchoge showed again why he is the No.1 marathon man in the world right now – and perhaps of all time – when he won the BMW Berlin Marathon on Sunday. The 32-year-old Kenyan owns the fastest marathon time in history, the Olympic title and here in Germany he clocked 2:03:32 to beat a star-studded field.</p>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">On 6 May, Kipchoge, along with Zersenay Tadese (then world record holder in the half marathon) and Lelisa Desisa (2 time Boston Marathon winner), attempted the first sub-two-hour assisted marathon, in the Nike Breaking2 project on the Monza Formula 1 racetrack near Milan, Italy. All 3 runners ran a test 2 months before the attempt. The target time was 1 hour for a half Marathon. Kipchoge finished first in 59:17. The course was measured at 2400 m per lap.During the 2-hour attempt, the runners were paced by a lead car and 30 supporting pacers joining in stages (both considered illegal under IAAF rules).The race started at 5:45h local time on the 2.4 km track. Kipchoge finished in 2:00:25, while the other two had to slow and finished far behind.The runners planned even 14:13 5k splits to break 2 hours. His 5k splits were: 14:14, 14:07, 14:13, 14:15, 14:14, 14:17, 14:17, 14:27, and 6:20 to finish. The 5k split times from 25k and further would be world records: 25k in 1:11:03, 30k in 1:25:20, 35k in 1:39:37, 40k in 1:54:04.</p>
                
                    <h2 class="font-bold text-4xl ml-9 mb-8 mt-8 ">2018</h2>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">Kipchoge won the London Marathon against a field that included Mo Farah, Kenenisa Bekele, and defending champion Daniel Wanjiru.</p>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">On 16 September, Kipchoge won the 2018 Berlin Marathon in a time of 2:01:39, breaking the previous world record by 1 minute and 18 seconds (2:02:57 set by fellow countryman Dennis Kimetto at the Berlin Marathon in 2014). It was the greatest improvement in a marathon world record time since 1967. He finished 4:43 min ahead of second-placed fellow Kenyan Amos Kipruto. The world record holder from 2013, Wilson Kipsang of Kenya, came in third at 2:06:48. </p>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">Following his performances in the 2018 season, Kipchoge received numerous accolades and awards. He was named IAAF World Athlete of the Year together with Caterine Ibargüen, who received the female World Athlete of the Year award.  On 11 January 2019, Kipchoge was named the 2018 Sportsman of the Year at the Kenyan Sports Personality of the Year Awards in Mombasa, Kenya. </p>
       

                    <h2 class="font-bold text-4xl ml-9 mb-8 mt-8 ">2019</h2>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">Kipchoge won the 2019 London Marathon in a time of 2:02:37, the second fastest marathon of all time, behind his 2018 Berlin Marathon win.  He became the first man to win the event four times and set a new course record, beating his own 2016 London Marathon best by 28 seconds. The lead runner passed the half marathon mark in 1:01:37. Mosinet Geremew (Ethiopia) finished as the runner up in 2:02:55 and Mule Wasihun (Ethiopia) came in third place in 2:03:16. The British runner Mo Farah, a four-time Olympic gold medalist and a pre-race favourite, finished 5th.</p>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">In May 2019, a few days after his London Marathon win, Kipchoge announced another take on the sub-two-hour marathon, named the Ineos 1:59 Challenge. On 12 October 2019 in Vienna's Prater park, he ran 4.4 laps of the Hauptallee in 1:59:40, becoming the first person in recorded history to break the two-hour barrier over a marathon distance. </p>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">The effort did not count as a new world record under IAAF rules due to the setup of the challenge. Specifically, it was not an open event, Kipchoge was handed fluids by his support team throughout, the run featured a pace car, and included rotating teams of other runners pacing Kipchoge in a formation designed to reduce wind resistance and maximise efficiency. The achievement was recognised by Guinness World Records with the titles 'Fastest marathon distance (male)' and 'First marathon distance run under two hours'. </p>

                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">Kipchoge placed 8th in the 2020 London Marathon in October with a time of 2:06:49, the lowest finish of his marathoning career.</p>

                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">In preparation for the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, he won the NN Mission Marathon, which was held at Enschede Airport Twente in the Netherlands on 18 April 2021, in a time of 2:04:30. Jonathan Korir finished as the runner up with a personal best of 2:06:40.</p>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">Kipchoge successfully defended his title from the Rio Olympics by winning the gold medal in the men's marathon at the Tokyo Games in a time of 2:08:38, becoming only the third person to successfully defend their gold medal in the men's marathon, after Abebe Bikila in 1960 and 1964, and Waldemar Cierpinski in 1976 and 1980. He was the favourite to win and attacked around the 30 km mark, looking back only once afterwards. The silver medal went to Abdi Nageeye (Netherlands) who finished 80 seconds after Kipchoge. Bashir Abdi (Belgium) came in third for a bronze medal with 2:10:00. Kipchoge was the oldest Olympic marathon winner since Carlos Lopes won in 1984 at the age of 37. The run was staged 500 miles north of Tokyo in Sapporo with 106 runners participating in the race. A documentary on the Ineos 1:59 Challenge, titled Kipchoge: The Last Milestone, was released digitally on-demand on 24 August 2021.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="font-bold text-4xl ml-9 mb-8 mt-8 ">2022</h2>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">On 20 January, Kipchoge announced his desire to win all 6 Abbott World Marathons Majors (he had already won 3, the London, Berlin, and Chicago marathons, by that time). This was followed up by an announcement on 18 February that he would be participating in the 2021 Tokyo Marathon (which would be held on 6 March 2022 due to COVID-19 restrictions in 2021), and that the majority of his recent training has been dedicated towards this goal. He won the Tokyo Marathon with a time of 2:02:40 – a course and all-comers' record. Amos Kipruto of Kenya finished second with a personal best of 2:03:13, and Tamirat Tola from Ethiopia came in third in a time of 2:04:14.</p>
                    <p class="text-1.5xl font-medium ml-5 mb-5">On 25 September, Kipchoge won decisively the 2022 Berlin Marathon in a time of 2:01:09, beating by 30 seconds his own previous world record which he set on the same course in 2018. With his fourth victory in Berlin, he equalled the record achievement of Haile Gebrselassie. He finished 4:49 min ahead of second-placed compatriot Mark Korir while Ethiopia's Tadu Abate took third place with a time of 2:06:28. Kipchoge achieved halfway in 59:51 which, being at the time the fastest split in marathon history, would have been a world record in the standalone half-marathon in 1993, and was only 26 seconds off his best in that distance. He slowed down later with second half in 61:18. It was the eighth time in a row that men's record was set in Berlin</p>

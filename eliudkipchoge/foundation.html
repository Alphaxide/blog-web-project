                <p>
                    I want those children to grow up into healthy adults in a green and breathing world where forests keep our people safe. I hope to contribute and grow the movement in education and environmental protection through my Foundation, to reach the people in the world with my voice. To raise awareness and to raise finances to build libraries, schools, forests. I was lucky in my life to have access to books and knowledge from a young age. It taught me to value life.

                <P class="mb-5 mt-3 text- 2xl pr-5">I am committed to assisting education programs within Kenya, but education is everywhere in the world and I would like to cross borders.</P>
                <P class="mb-5 mt-3 text- 2xl pr-5">From my own experience, I saw that most athletes dropped out of school and tried to build a life without education. But with education, it can help you grow and it can help you grow your community alongside you. My dream is for all schools and kindergartens in the world have good libraries. From a very young age, children need to get in contact with books, with learning. This builds a good foundation for children. The library is the place to get information.</P>
                <P class="mb-5 mt-3 text- 2xl pr-5">Books can inspire. Through books, people can share their experience and knowledge, also to those who do not have access to internet, I was inspired by books. There are a lot of talented people in Africa and around the world, who may get inspired and help to solve problems people are facing in their communities.</P>

                <P class="mb-5 mt-3 text- 2xl pr-5">Athletes train in the forest. They need the forests, it is good for their health and for good breathing. I want the world to breath well. Without forests, you cannot breath.</P>
                <P class="mb-5 mt-3 text- 2xl pr-5">As a farmer myself, I know about the importance of a good environment, of trees, of using the land in a sustainable way, so people can grow healthy food and plants, also for the next generations. I believe together we can make dry land green again, which has a huge impact on biodiversity, water availability and healthy food.</P>
                <p class="mb-5 mt-3 text- 2xl pr-5">You can always start helping, even by adopting trees. I began already with adopting a forest near our training camp to help save it. I want to reach out to help save and grow forests around the world.</p>
